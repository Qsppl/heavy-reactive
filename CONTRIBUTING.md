# Contributing

This project uses a modular and declarative approach to reactive state modeling. Contributions should follow the existing architectural principles and naming conventions.

## Guidelines

- **Favor composability**: use primitives that compose cleanly (e.g. `$Set`, `$Value`, `$Intersection`).
- **Use explicit projection**: all transformation logic should be placed inside `resolver()` functions, not inline.
- **Respect read-only boundaries**: all derived sets must be immutable from the outside.
- **Avoid entanglement**: prefer isolated reactive nodes and explicit connections between them.

## Internal Structure

The system is composed of core reactive types:

- `$Value<T>`: reactive container for a single value
- `$Set<T>`: reactive observable Set<T>
- `$Combination<T>`: abstract base for derived reactive sets

The system also supports composition tools like:

- `$Intersection`
- `$Union`
- `$Difference`
- Projection-based operators (see below)

## üß≠ Projection-Based Derived Sets

Projection sets derive their contents from a **superset** and a set of **relation keys**, using a custom `resolver()` function.

These keys are not filtered against the superset directly. Instead, each key is **projected** into one or more values from the superset via the resolver. This enables reactive relationships such as:

- tags ‚Üí items
- roles ‚Üí permissions
- categories ‚Üí associated content

### Core concepts:

| Concept         | Meaning                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Superset        | The source set of all possible values                                 |
| Relation keys   | Keys that drive projection; can be a `$Value<T>` or `$Set<T>`         |
| Resolver        | Function mapping relation keys to projected values                    |
| Mask (optional) | If used (`complement`), excludes the projected values from the result |
| Result          | `$Set<TResult>` that includes or excludes projected values reactively |

### Supported patterns:

| Class               | Description                            | Projection Source | Masking |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| `$SubsetViaVal`     | one key ‚Üí values to include            | `$Value<T>`       | No      |
| `$SubsetViaSet`     | many keys ‚Üí union of values to include | `$Set<T>`         | No      |
| `$ComplementViaVal` | one key ‚Üí values to exclude            | `$Value<T>`       | Yes     |
| `$ComplementViaSet` | many keys ‚Üí union of values to exclude | `$Set<T>`         | Yes     |
| `$SetFromSet`       | delta ‚Üí transformed delta              | `$Set<T>`         | No      |

Resolvers must handle changes incrementally and support projection semantics. Values in the relation input are **not** result values ‚Äî they are _keys to compute with_.

## üîÅ Synchronization and Delta Buffers

Reactive projection sets use internal delta buffers to accumulate uncommitted changes from their dependencies. These are represented by `DeltaBufferForSet` and `DeltaBufferForValue`.

Each buffer tracks:

- The last committed state
- The current uncommitted (pending) changes
- Emits `.onChange` when pending state changes

A `synchronize()` loop iterates over all active buffers, resolves the next pending delta via the `resolver()`, commits the result, and repeats until no further deltas are detected.

This model ensures:

- Asynchronous-safe updates
- Deterministic reactivity
- Efficient batching

## üß© Architectural Roadmap

The current architecture relies on specialized subclasses like `$SubsetViaSet`, `$ComplementViaVal`, etc.
We plan to:

- **Generalize projection logic** across value- and set-based dependencies.
- **Extract cascade propagation** into a dedicated coordination layer to allow priority control.
- **Modularize node activation/deactivation**, allowing better lifecycle tracking and isolation.
- **Split user-side effects** from core propagation to optimize dependency traversal.

All contributors are encouraged to keep these directions in mind and submit helpers or refactors that support this direction.

## üìê Architectural References

This reactive model borrows from:

- **Projectional transformation** (graph queries, RDB joins)
- **Incremental computation** (dataflow graphs, spreadsheet logic)
- **Observer pattern** via `Signal`
- **CRDT-style overwrite propagation** in overwrite mode

All combinators must be:

- Pull-based from source
- Push-updated via `applyChanges()`
- Isolation-tolerant (able to disable/re-enable cleanly)

---

## üß™ Testing

All changes must be accompanied by unit tests for new logic, and regression tests for fixed bugs.

Use the existing test harness under `/test` and add specs per feature/module.
