/**
 * Reactive set representing the union of multiple source sets.
 *
 * `$Union<T>` tracks a dynamic collection of input `$Set<T>` instances
 * and computes their union — that is, the result contains all values
 * that are present in **at least one** of the source sets.
 *
 * This class extends `$VariadicCombination<T>` and is designed to maintain
 * a live, reactive aggregation of elements from all its inputs.
 *
 * The resulting set is:
 * - **readonly** — user-level mutations are forbidden and will throw;
 * - **reactive** — emits `onChange` when any included value is added or removed;
 * - **fully derived** — its content reflects only the union of source sets.
 *
 * @template TValue The type of values in the sets.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const $a = $set(['x', 'y'])
 * const $b = $set(['y', 'z'])
 *
 * const $combined = new $Union([$a, $b])
 *
 * console.log([...$combined]) // ['x', 'y', 'z']
 *
 * $a.delete('x')
 * console.log([...$combined]) // ['y', 'z']
 * ```
