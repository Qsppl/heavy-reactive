/**
 * Reactive delta buffer for a `$Set<T>`.
 *
 * `DeltaBufferForSet` observes changes from a reactive `$Set` source
 * and accumulates a pending change set, separated into additions and removals.
 * These changes can later be committed and consumed as an atomic delta.
 *
 * This buffering mechanism enables controlled, stepwise propagation
 * of updates across multiple reactive dependencies without race conditions or redundant work.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 * - When enabled, the buffer listens to `.onChange` of the source set.
 * - All changes are accumulated incrementally in two sets:
 *   - `pendingAdded` — new elements added to the source
 *   - `pendingRemoved` — elements removed from the source
 * - When `commitState()` is called:
 *   - both pending buffers are cleared
 *   - `getCommitted()` becomes valid
 *
 * ### Usage
 * This buffer is used internally in `$SetFromAny` to manage deferred application
 * of changes and is compatible with `TDependencySetResolver` functions.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const buffer = new DeltaBufferForSet("source", $tags, resolve, true)
 *
 * const delta = buffer.getBufferedChange()
 * const result = await resolve(context, delta)
 * buffer.commitState()
 * ```
