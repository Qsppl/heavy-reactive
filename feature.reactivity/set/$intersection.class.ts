/**
 * Reactive set that computes the intersection of multiple source sets.
 *
 * `$Intersection<T>` tracks a dynamic list of reactive sets (inputs),
 * and continuously computes their intersection — i.e., only values
 * that are present in **every** source set are included in the result.
 *
 * This class is a specialized form of `$VariadicCombination<T>` and `$Combination<T>`,
 * and is useful for deriving consistent shared state between multiple inputs.
 *
 * The resulting set is:
 * - read-only: all mutation methods throw `ReadonlyAccessError`;
 * - reactive: emits `onChange` when the intersection result changes;
 * - derived: changes automatically as inputs change.
 *
 * @template TValue The type of values stored in each source set.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const $setA = $set(['a', 'b', 'c'])
 * const $setB = $set(['b', 'c', 'd'])
 *
 * const $common = new $Intersection([$setA, $setB])
 *
 * console.log([...$common]) // ['b', 'c']
 *
 * $setA.delete('b')
 * console.log([...$common]) // ['c']
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class is not intended for direct mutation.
 * Use the source sets to control the state.
