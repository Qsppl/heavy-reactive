# Heavy Reactive

Lightweight TypeScript primitives for reactive programming with heavy computations, optimized to handle hundreds of thousands of objects in real-time streams. The library provides explicit control over complex data flows through subscription-based patterns while avoiding magic and overhead. It supports cancellation, lazy evaluation, and efficient set operations at scale without garbage collection pressure. Designed for seamless integration in any architecture, it works without global state or framework dependencies.

The core maintains constant-time operations even with massive datasets, processing only what changes through granular differential updates. You get precise memory control and zero-implicit reactivity waterfalls while working with plain JavaScript objects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install the library:

```bash
npm install @your-scope/reactive-state
```

Import the reactive primitives:

```ts
import { $value, $set, $intersectionSets, $unionSets, $differenceSets } from "@your-scope/reactive-state"
```

## ✨ Core Concepts

### `$value()` – Reactive Value

Wraps a single value in a reactive container:

```ts
const count = $value({ value: 0 })
count.onChange.subscribe(({ increment }) => {
    console.log("New value:", increment?.value)
})
count.value = 1
```

### `$set()` – Reactive Set

Reactive equivalent of `Set<T>`:

```ts
const $tags = $set({ values: ["a", "b"] })
$tags.add("c")
$tags.delete("a")
```

Supports:

- `.onChange` with `{ increment?, decrement? }`
- `batchAdd`, `batchDelete`, `applyChanges`
- Transactions via `openTransaction` / `closeTransaction`

### Combinations

Use derived sets to represent computed relationships:

```ts
const $admin = $set({ values: ["alice", "bob"] })
const $online = $set({ values: ["bob", "carol"] })

const $onlineAdmins = $intersectionSets({ subsets: [$admin, $online] })
```

Available combinators:

- `$intersectionSets()` — only values present in all
- `$unionSets()` — all values from any
- `$differenceSets()` — values in one but not others

All combination sets:

- Are strictly readonly — you cannot call `add()` or `delete()` on them.
- Automatically update when their source sets change.
- Can be toggled on/off via the `enabled` flag to reduce reactivity and resource usage.

### 🏗 Factory Functions

Factory functions provide named creation helpers for all key reactive types.

#### Base factories

- `$value(...)` – Create a reactive value container
- `$set(...)` – Create a reactive set container

#### Projection-based set factories

- `$subsetViaVal(...)` – Build a projected subset using a relation stored in a `$Value`
- `$subsetViaSet(...)` – Build a projected subset using a set of relation keys in a `$Set`
- `$complementViaVal(...)` – Build a complement set by excluding a projection from a single relation value
- `$complementViaSet(...)` – Build a complement set by excluding projected values from multiple relation keys
- `$setFromSet(...)` – Build a projected set that maps source deltas into custom results

Each factory returns a `$Combination<T>` instance.

Projection factories enable expressive modeling such as:

```ts
const $roles = $value({ value: "admin" })
const $allPermissions = $set({ values: ["read", "write", "delete"] })

const $granted = $subsetViaVal({
    superset: $allPermissions,
    relation: $roles,
    resolver: (all, role) => (role.value === "admin" ? all : [...all].filter((p) => p !== "delete")),
})
```

## 🧠 Use Cases

### Cascade Filtering and Aggregation

```ts
const $allItems = $set({ values: ["a", "b", "c", "d"] })
const $archived = $set({ values: ["b"] })
const $selected = $set({ values: ["a", "b", "d"] })

const $visible = $differenceSets({ superset: $allItems, subsets: [$archived] })
const $visibleSelected = $intersectionSets({ subsets: [$selected, $visible] })

// → $visibleSelected contains ['a', 'd']

$archived.add("d")
// → $visible now excludes 'd'
// → $visibleSelected now becomes ['a']
```

This showcases how combinations compose:

- `$differenceSets` subtracts exclusions;
- `$intersectionSets` refines the view.

### ⚠️ Readonly Behavior of Combinations

All combination sets are readonly and cannot be modified directly.
Attempting to call mutating methods such as `.add()` or `.delete()` will throw a runtime error:

```ts
const $onlineAdmins = $intersectionSets({ subsets: [$admin, $online] })

$onlineAdmins.add("carol")
// ❌ RuntimeError: $Intersection is readonly and cannot be modified.
```

To update the contents, always mutate the source sets directly:

```ts
$online.add("carol")
// ✅ Triggers recomputation of $onlineAdmins
```

### Reactive Tag System

```ts
const $tagsA = $set({ values: ["x", "y"] })
const $tagsB = $set({ values: ["y", "z"] })
const $commonTags = $intersectionSets({ subsets: [$tagsA, $tagsB] })

$tagsA.delete("y")
// $commonTags → Set { } (now empty)
```

### Reducing Reactivity to Save Resources

All reactive combinations can be temporarily disabled:

```ts
$commonTags.disable() // stops responding to changes
$commonTags.enable() // resumes tracking intersection
```

This is useful for optimizing performance:

- Pause unused derived state during inactive UI screens.
- Avoid unnecessary recomputations when state is backgrounded.

## 🔁 Subscriptions and Signals

All reactive entities expose signals like `.onChange` or `.onSwitch`
hese signals emit typed payloads and support cancellation:

```ts
const ctrl = new AbortController()
$tags.onChange.subscribe(
    ({ increment, decrement }) => {
        console.log("Updated:", increment, decrement)
    },
    { signal: ctrl.signal },
)
```
